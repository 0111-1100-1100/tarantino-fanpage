				<h3>Reservoir Dogs (1992)</h3>

				<input id="read-more-toggle-1" class="read-more-toggle" type="checkbox">

				<div class="read-more-content">
					<p>Six criminals, who are strangers to each other, are hired by a crime boss, Joe Cabot, to carry out a diamond robbery. Right at the outset, they are given false names with the intention that they won't get too close and will concentrate on the job instead. They are completely sure that the robbery is going to be a success. But, when the police show up right at the time and the site of the robbery, panic spreads amongst the group members, and two of them are killed in the subsequent shootout, along with a few policemen and civilians. When the remaining people assemble at the premeditated rendezvous point (a warehouse), they begin to suspect that one of them is an undercover cop. <br><i>- Written by Soumitra</i><br><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105236/" target="_blank">See on IMDB</a></p>

				<h3>Jackie Brown (1997)</h3>

				<input id="read-more-toggle-3" class="read-more-toggle" type="checkbox">

				<div class="read-more-content">
					<p>Jackie Brown is the name of a flight attendant who gets caught smuggling her boss's gun money on the airline she works for. Luckily for her, Fed Ray Nicolet and L.A. cop Mark Dargus decide to team up in order to arrest the arms dealer she works for, whose name they don't even know. Here's when she has to choose one way: tell Nicolet and Dargus about Ordell Robbie (the arms dealer) and get her freedom-except that if Ordell suspects you're talking about him, you're dead-or keep her mouth shut and do some time. That's when she meets Max Cherry, her bail bondsman, a recently separated, burnt-out man in his late fifties, who falls in love with her. Then Jackie comes up with a plan to play the Feds off against Ordell and the guys he works with-Louis Gara and Melanie Ralston, among others-and walk off with their money. But she needs Max's help. No one is going to stand in the way of his million-dollar payoff. <br><i>- Written by Héctor Barca</i><br><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119396/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">See on IMDB</a></p>

				<h3>Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)</h3>

				<input id="read-more-toggle-5" class="read-more-toggle" type="checkbox">

				<div class="read-more-content">
					<p>It all began when the nefarious Deadly Viper Assassination Squad moved in and assassinated the Plympton wedding party at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel in El Paso, TX. Well, all but one: The Bride, their real target. All they managed to do to her was put her in a coma. And four years later, she woke up and swore revenge on the lot of them. It began with the disposing of O-Ren Ishii/"Cottonmouth" and Vernita Green/"Copperhead". Now, the "Black Mamba" has only three left on her Death List: Budd/"Sidewinder", Bill's brother; Elle Driver/"California Mountain Snake", the deadly one-eyed assassin; and, of course, Bill/"Snake Charmer", her boss, teacher, and lover. However, Bill does possess one thing that keeps the ball in his court: B.B., the daughter the Bride thought she had lost in her coma. And now, at this point, the Bride knows only one thing: in the end, she will kill Bill. <br><i>- Written by Will</i><br><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/?ref_=tt_rec_tt" target="_blank">See on IMDB</a></p>

				<h3>Inglourious Basterds (2009)</h3>

				<input id="read-more-toggle-7" class="read-more-toggle" type="checkbox">

				<div class="read-more-content">
					<p>It's WWII, the battleground, Nazi-occupied France. The Nazis are doing whatever they need to to flush out and exterminate Jews, the most proficient and prolific of the Jew hunters being the sadistic SS Colonel Hans Landa. As such, the American military forms a unit, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine and comprised of eight Jews, to kill as many Nazis as possible. Raine requests each of his men to bring him the scalp of at least 100 Nazis apiece. He has his own method of ensuring that those Nazis he does allow or need to let go free are scarred for life. In Paris in 1944, Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi's chief propaganda master and filmmaker, plans to debut his latest film, "Nation's Pride". The film, based on the victorious military exploits of Private Fredrick Zoller, stars Zoller as himself. Because of his attraction to its pretty proprietress Emmanuelle Mimieux, Zoller convinces Goebbels and the Nazi brass to hold the premiere at Mimieux's cinema. Landa is to act as chief of security for the event. When the Americans get wind of the screening and the fact that most of the Nazi highers-up will be in attendance, Raine's team is tasked with blowing up the cinema during the screening. They are assisted by renowned German actress, Bridget von Hammersmark, who has been working as a spy for the British. They believe luck is on their side when they learn that Hitler himself is scheduled to attend. Beyond being found out, Raine's team face two as of yet unknown issues. The first is Mimieux, who is really Shoshanna Dreyfus, a Jew who saw her family brutally murdered by Landa four years earlier, and who may have her own plans for Landa and the Nazis. The second is Landa, who beyond his up front mission, has another more personal mission for his life post-war unknown to anyone but himself. <br><i>- Written by Huggo</i><br><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361748/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">See on IMDB</a></p>
